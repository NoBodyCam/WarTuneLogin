WarTuneLogin
============

Simple script to login a WarTune character in and run them in a circle.

Note: 
 This script was written and tested on ubuntu 13.04. I make no clames that
 it will work. I will say that as of the time the script was posted it did
 work for me. With a newly created WarTune character.
